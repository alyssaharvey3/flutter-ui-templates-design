# Welcome Contributors ðŸ‘‹
The Robotics Forum always encourages new ideas.

# Aim
Main aim of this repository is to make things faster and convenient for all the flutter developers who just want to save their time in their flutter development. This repository consists of all the development widgets that are being commonly used while coding end to end mobile screens in flutter. The goal is to save your time by providing the complete code snippet which follows standard dart conventions with a fully responsive and interactive design of all the components that you may use in your development journey. At the later stage, the project is planned to be converted into a library and packages so that the components created can directly be used by importing and calling through classes. 

# Objectives

- Creating end-to-end mobile app templates.
- Refinement of pre-existing UI. 
- Work on interactions and effects/animations.
